class BsplineBasis:

    """
    Generate a univariate uniform B-spline basis from a regressor vector. The
    knot sequence is defined using `n_int + 2 * deg + 1` evenly spaced knots so
    that the (`deg` + 1)-th knot coincides with the minimum value of `xsample` and
    the (`n_int` + `deg` + 1) matches the maximum value of `xsample`. The B-spline
    basis may be extended outwards the range defined by `xsample` adding extra
    knots (preserving the same step length) to the knot sequence as it is done
    in Currie I., Durban M. and Eilers P. (2004).

    Parameters
    ----------
    xsample : np.ndarray
        The regressor vector. Must be a unidimensional array.
    deg : int, optional
        The polynomial degree of the B-spline basis. Must be a non-negative
        integer. By default, 3.
    n_int : int, optional
        The number of equal intervals which [min(`xsample`), max(`xsample`)] is
        split. Must be greater or equal than 2. By default, 40.
    prediction : Dict[str, Union[int, float]], optional
        A dictionary containing the most extreme values that the extended
        basis needs to capture. The keys are 'backwards' and 'forward',
        depending on the direction which the basis must be extended, and the
        values are the points on the basis axis. If 'backwards' ('forward') keys
        is not empty, the value must be at the left (right) of the minimum
        (maximum) value of 'xsample'. By default, {}.

    Attributes
    ----------
    int_back : int
        The number of extra knots used to extend the B-spline basis to the left.
    int_forw : int
        The number of extra knots used to extend the B-spline basis to the right.
    knots : np.ndarray of shape (`n_int` + 2 * `deg` + 1, )
        The knot sequence of the B-spline basis.
    bspline_basis : scipy.interpolate.Bspline
        The `n_int` + `int_back` + `int_forw` + `deg` elements of the B-spline basis.
    matrixB : np.ndarray of shape (`int_back` + len(`xsample`) + `int_forw`,
        `n_int` + `deg`)
        The design matrix of the B-spline basis. The ij-th element of the matrix
        contains the evaluation of the j-th B-spline from the basis at the i-th
        element of the vector `xsample`.
