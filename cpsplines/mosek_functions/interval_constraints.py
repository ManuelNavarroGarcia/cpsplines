class IntConstraints:

    """
    Define the set of constraints that ensures the non-negativity (or
    non-positivity) for the derivative order `derivative` along the respective
    axis of the variable `var_name`. For the unidimensional case, the
    requirements are completely fulfilled for every point in the range where the
    B-spline basis is defined. For the multivariate case, the constraints are
    imposed at the curves that pass through the inner knots of the B-spline
    basis. For all cases, the constraints are imposed following the Proposition
    1 in Bertsimas and Popescu (2002).

    Parameters
    ----------
    bspline : Iterable[BsplineBasis]
        An iterable containing the B-spline bases objects used to approximate
        the function to estimate.
    var_name : int
        The name of the variable along the constraints are imposed. Must be a
        non-negative integer.
    derivative : int
        The derivative order of the function that needs to be constrained. Must
        be a non-negative integer.
    constraints : Dict[str, Union[int, float]]
        The constraints that are imposed. The keys of the dictionary are either
        "+" (the function (or some derivative) needs to be above some threshold)
        or "-" (the function (or some derivative) needs to be below some
        threshold), and the values are the thresholds.

    Attributes
    ----------
    deg_w : int
        The shape of the matrices W.
    matricesW : List[np.ndarray] of shape (deg_w, deg_w)
        The matrices W used to impose the constraints by virtue of Proposition 1
        in Bertsimas and Popescu (2002).
    matricesH : mosek.fusion.Matrix
        Auxiliary matrices to extract the correct coefficients from the positive
        semidefinite matrix variable in the left-hand side from the equations of
        Proposition 1 in Bertsimas and Popescu (2002).
